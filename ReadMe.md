# Anamoly Detection using DetectNet and Jetson-Nano
This project makes use of the detectnet model and deploys it on a jetson-nano device to detect anomalies. Anomalies are detected when there is a person in the frame for more than 5 seconds. 

This project makes use of pretrained models along with OpenCV for frame manipulation
